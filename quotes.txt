The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Dream big and dare to fail.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
The future depends on what you do today.
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
The only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday.
The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
